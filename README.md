## Quickstart

```sh
# Installs all dependencies
npm install

# Asks you which exercise you'd like to run, and runs it
npm run exercise
```

## How to take the course

The course is split into exercises. Each exercise is split into a `*.problem` and a `*.solution`.

To take an exercise:

1. Run `npm run exercise`
2. Choose which exercise you'd like to run.

This course encourages **active, exploratory learning**. **You'll be asked to try to find a solution**. To attempt a solution, you'll need to:

1. Check out [TypeScript's docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html) or the [React TypeScript cheatsheet](https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/)
1. Try to find something that looks relevant.
1. Give it a go to see if it solves the problem.

You'll know if you've succeeded because the tests will pass.
